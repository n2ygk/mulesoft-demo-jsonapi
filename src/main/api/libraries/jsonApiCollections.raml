#%RAML 1.0 Library
usage: >
  jsonapi collection-item resourceTypes library: jsonapi-based resourceTypes and traits.
  
  This is a companion to the jsonApiLibrary.raml Library. 
  
  Usage:
  ```
  uses:
    col: libraries/jsonApiCollections.raml
  ```
  
  For reasons I don't quite understand, you must use this with the same `uses` key name
  (api) in your main api.raml and any other libraries that reference types defined in jsonApiLibrary.raml.
  For other reasons I don't understand, this can't just be part of jsonApiLibrary.raml but that's probably
  for the best as this is hand-coded.
