#%RAML 1.0 Library
# traits (sorting, filtering), resourceTypes (collections, items) etc. are defined in jsonApiCollections.raml
usage: >
  This library defines RAML types for [{json:api} 1.0](http://jsonapi.org/format) RESTful API responses.
  
  This library of RAML types is derived directly from the json-api 1.0 [specification](https://github.com/json-api/json-api/blob/gh-pages/schema)
  which is coded using the [json-schema.org](http://json-schema.org/documentation.html) specification. 
  
  The following CHANGES have been made from the schema's YAML:
    - resource.id is _not_ required because for POST request body it is optional whereas it is mandatory for response body.
      I'm not super-happy with this. Find a fix.
    - I couldn't represent allOf for `links` so made a `pagelinks` type which extends `link`.
    - Fix attributes and relationships types (patternProperties not directly mappable to RAML)
    - Move type: up for readability and changed type: array/items: into just type: itemtype[]
  
  See the related jsonApiCollections.raml Library for useful resourceTypes and traits that uses these types.
  
  Jsonapi uses mediatype `application/vnd.api+json` in requests and responses. 

  Example usage:
  ```
  uses:
    api: jsonApiLibrary.raml
  ...
  /widgets:
    get:
      responses: 
        200:
          body: 
            application/vnd.api+json:
              type: api.success
              properties: 
                data: widget[]
  ```
  
  Make your API-specific `data` types subclasses of api.resource and your methods should use type api.success
  for successful responses and api.failure for failure responses.
  
  For reasons I don't quite understand, you must use this with the same `uses` key name
  (api) in your main api.raml and any other libraries that reference types defined here.
  
  This file is mostly machine-generated by reading the jsonapi.json 1.0 schema and converting to YAML and then RAML.
